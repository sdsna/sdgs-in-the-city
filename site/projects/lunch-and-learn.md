title: SDG Lunch & Learn
description: >-
  The biggest industries in New York City include the fashion industry, the
  financial services industry, and the food industry. There is an opportunity to
  leverage the learnings and efforts of the [SDGs](#goals) to help New York
  City-based businesses to better integrate sustainable development practices
  into their business model and operations more intimately. Our team will help
  them to do so by connecting them to networks and resources that already exist
  that are relevant to their particular industry through short, informal
  knowledge sharing sessions about the SDGs either in-person or virtually
  through a lunch and learn module.


  We are still in the process of defining this module. If youâ€™re interested in
  getting involved, providing feedback, or learning more, please write to [Elena
  Crete](mailto:elena.crete@unsdsn.org).
