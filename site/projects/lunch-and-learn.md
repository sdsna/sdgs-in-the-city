title: SDG Lunch & Learn
description: >-
  The biggest industries in New York City include the fashion industry, the
  financial services industry, and the food industry. There is an opportunity to
  leverage the learnings and efforts of the [SDGs](#goals) to help New York
  City-based businesses to better integrate sustainable development practices
  into their business model and operations more intimately. SDSN staff will help
  them to do so by connecting them to networks and resources that already exist
  that are relevant to their particular industry. 

   The SDSN team will deliver information and advice on how a business can localize the SDGs and improve their business through two mechanisms: 

  * We will offer short, informal knowledge sharing sessions about the SDGs
  either in-person or virtually through a lunch and learn module.

  * Second, by curating and connecting businesses to curated documentation of
  networks and resources that are already available to them, but perhaps they
  just don't know about or don't understand.


  SDSN is still in the process of defining this module. If youâ€™re interested in
  getting involved, providing feedback, or learning more, please write to Elena
  Crete.
