title: SDG Lunch & Learn
description: >-
  The biggest industries in New York City include the fashion industry, the
  financial services industry, and the food industry. There is an opportunity to
  leverage the learnings and efforts of the [SDGs](#goals) to help New York
  City-based businesses better integrate sustainable development practices
  into their business model and operations more intimately. Our team will help by connecting businesses to existing networks and resources that are relevant to their particular industry through short, in-person or virtual knowledge sharing lunch and learn sessions about the SDGs.


  If youâ€™re interested in getting involved, providing feedback, or learning more, please write to [Elena Crete](mailto:elena.crete@unsdsn.org).
