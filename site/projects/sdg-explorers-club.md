  The [SDG Explorers Club](https://sdgexplorers.club) takes you on a hunt across NYC to discover the SDGs in
  museums, parks, and even your own neighborhood!


  Our team is partnering with institutions to help explorers identify exhibits,
  collections, or items that align with the SDGs. Explorers are encouraged to
  share pictures of what they discover by tagging an SDG Explorers Club social
  media account or using the hashtag [#FindYourSDGs](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/findyoursdgs/) and [#SDGExplorers.](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sdgexplorers/)


  SDG Explorers can also contribute their own favorite exhibits, collections, or
  cultural locations to a crowdsourced map of SDG-related content in the city,
  adding even more opportunities for SDGs Explorers to collect all 17 SDGs.
