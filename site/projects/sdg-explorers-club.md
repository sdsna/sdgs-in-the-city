title: SDG Explorers Club
description: >-
  The SDG Explorers Club takes New York area children (and adults!) on a
  scavenger hunt across the five boroughs to discover the SDGs in museums,
  galleries, and other cultural institutions. SDSN will partner with
  institutions to help them identify exhibits, collections, or items that align
  with the SDGs, which will then be marked with the appropriate SDG icon.
  Visitors will receive an SDG Explorers Club Passport to keep track of the SDGs
  they discover, and will be encouraged to share pictures of what they discover
  by tagging an SDG Explorers Club social media account or using the hashtag
  #SDGsintheCity. SDG Explorers can also contribute their own favorite exhibits,
  collections, or cultural locations to a crowdsourced map of SDG-related
  content in the city, adding even more opportunities for SDGs Explorers to
  collect all 17 SDGs.
