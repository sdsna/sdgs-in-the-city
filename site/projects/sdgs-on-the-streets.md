title: SDGs on the Streets
description: >-
  Our team will join Car Free Earth Day in NYC on Saturday, April 27th. Broadway will be closed to automobile traffic from Times Square to Union Square, and will feature art installations, activities, and booths from community organizations.


  Our booth will feature a spinning wheel with the 17 SDGs, from which
  participants will spin for an SDG and receive an invitation to partake in a
  related personal action. We will collect the social media handles from those
  who successfully completed their action, and then will enter them into a
  raffle to win tickets to the [2019 International Conference on Sustainable Development (ICSD)](http://ic-sd.org/) and books signed by Jeffrey Sachs.


  Our goal is to engage the public in the SDG framework and inspire a behavior
  change with a single action.
