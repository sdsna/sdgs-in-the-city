title: SDGs on the Streets
description: >-
  The SDSN will join Car Free Earth Day on Saturday, April 27th. Broadway will
  be closed to automobile traffic from Times Square to Union Square, and will
  feature art installations, activities, and booths from community
  organizations.


  Our booth will feature a spinning wheel with the 17 SDGs, from which
  participants will spin for an SDG and receive an invitation to partake in a
  related personal action. SDSN will collect the social media handles from those
  who successfully completed their action, and then will enter them into a
  raffle to win tickets to ICSD and books signed by Jeffrey Sachs. 


  The goal is to engage the public in the SDG framework, and inspire a behaviour
  change with a single action.
