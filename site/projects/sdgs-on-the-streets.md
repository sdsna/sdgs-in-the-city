title: SDGs on the Streets
---
SDSN will showcase the SDGs in the City Program through a series of community engagement activities that include hosting a booth at Car Free Earth Day on Saturday, April 27 and the Summer Streets Festival that occurs on the first three saturdays of August. The booth will distribute information about the SDGs and the opportunities of the SDGs in the City Program to passers-by and will feature an “SDG wheel” that participants can spin to receive an SDG-related action they can take to advance a particular SDG. Actions will be incentivized by social media exposure and prize drawings.
