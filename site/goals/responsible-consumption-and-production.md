excerpt: >-
  The world’s nations (through the UN) have already agreed to a “10-year
  framework” to make the way we produce and consume goods more sustainable. This

* Avoid single-use, plastic products. Think straws, bags, utensils, coffee/tea pods, and bottles!
* Compost your food waste at an [NYC Greenmarket or local drop-off location](https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/ourmarkets), and ask your landlord to implement [NYC Organic pick-up](https://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2165/organics-collection). 
* Grocery shop for fewer items on a more frequent basis to reduce spoilage.
* [Properly dispose of batteries and electronics.](https://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/4661/electronic-disposal-information)
