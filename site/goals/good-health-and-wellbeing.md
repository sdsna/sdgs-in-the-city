excerpt: >-
  Over the last 15 years, the number of childhood deaths has been cut in half.
  This proves that it is possible to win the fight against almost every disease.
  Still, we are spending an astonishing amount of money and resources on
  treating illnesses that are surprisingly easy to prevent. The new goal for
  worldwide Good Health promotes healthy lifestyles, preventive measures and
  modern, efficient healthcare for everyone.
