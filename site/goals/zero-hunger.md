title: Zero Hunger
number: 2
tagline: >-
  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
  sustainable agriculture.
excerpt: >-
  Hunger is the leading cause of death in the world. Our planet has provided us
  with tremendous resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling leaves
  millions of people malnourished. If we promote sustainable agriculture with
  modern technologies and fair distribution systems, we can sustain the whole
  worldâ€™s population and make sure that nobody will ever suffer from hunger
  again.
