title: Decent Work and Economic Growth
number: 8
tagline: >-
  Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and
  productive employment and decent work for all.
excerpt: >-
  At least 75 million young people around the world, aged 15-24, are unemployed,
  out of school, and looking at a bleak future. This Goal, while calling for
  economic growth to help close that gap, also calls for innovation and for
  “decoupling” growth from ecosystem degradation.
