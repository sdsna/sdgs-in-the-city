title: Sustainable Cities and Communities
number: 11
tagline: 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable'
excerpt: >-
  More than half the world lives in cities, and by 2050, at least 66% will — and
  most of the growth in cities is happening in Africa and Asia. If those cities
  are not sustainable, the world will not be, either. This Goal also covers
  issues like transportation, disaster preparedness, and even the preservation
  of “the world’s cultural and natural heritage.”
