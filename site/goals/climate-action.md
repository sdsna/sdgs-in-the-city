title: Climate Action
number: 13
tagline: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
excerpt: >-
  An analysis by the World Meteorological Organization shows that the five-year
  average global temperature from 2013 to 2017 was the highest on record. The
  world continues to experience rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions
  (the North Atlantic hurricane season was the costliest ever recorded) and
  increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. This calls for urgent and
  accelerated action by countries as they implement their commitments to the
  Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
