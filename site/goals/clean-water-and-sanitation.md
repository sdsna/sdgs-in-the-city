tagline: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.
excerpt: >-
  Too many people still lack access to safely managed water supplies and
  sanitation facilities. Water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper wastewater
  management also hinder social and economic development. Increasing water
  efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the
  competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users.
