title: Life Below Water
number: 14
tagline: >-
  Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for
  sustainable development.
excerpt: >-
  Global oceans and the life within them are over-fished, under-protected, and
  stressed from climate change and pollution. This Goal describes what we must
  do to save them — which includes research and learning, because we understand
  so little about what lies under the water’s surface.
