tagline: >-
  Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide
  access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive
  institutions at all levels.
excerpt: >-
  Reduce violence. End torture. Decrease the production and flow of arms. Reduce
  corruption. Create governments and institutions that work for everyone. This
  important Goal also includes a Target that specifically calls for policies to
  promote sustainable development â€” which would certainly include the
  implementation of the SDGs themselves.
